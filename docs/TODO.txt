# Things to be done


## Main Tasks

- text selection (1day, 1-2day)


## Minor Tasks

- overview (1day)
- finalize keyboard shortcuts (1day)
- themes + appearance (1day)
- check API (1 day)
- tests and IE (5 days)


## SproutCore compliance checking

- new image fitting approach in SC.ImageView (from SC.InnerFrame mixin)
- new animation approach introduced in 1.10.0
- in mixins, make sure properties are initialized in initMixin() and destroyed in destroyMixin(), in order to avoid them being shared by all client ojects
- replace extend() by design() in view declarations
- remove use of "treeItemChildrenKey" (chap. "Tree Controller" in Tyler's book)
- move functionality out of record classes into controllers (chap. "Working with SproutCore's controllers" in Tyler's book)


## Related to code review and documentation

- review TODOs
- add unit tests
- rewrite root README in MarkDown
- update loading pages (Multivio.loadingPage and loading.rhtml)
- CSS: remove all classes starting with '.sc-*' (use '.mvo-' instead, together with the 'classNames' property in the views)
- check and adapt help text (start from current production text)
- the tools in the side toolbar are all mutually exclusive (should be the case only for some of them)
- replace use of SC.Animatable mixin (deprecated) with SC.View.animate()
- anchor infoPane to top of window, instead of top of image
- reactivate fade transitions
- check if zoom fully functional (including enabled button status)
- factor out waitingView?
- show navigation toolbar after image loading
- reactivate navigation toolbar on mouse hover
- try to include several images of the same record in the same thumbnail view


## Code-tidy

- check JSDoc compliance `jsdoc2 -d=docs/jsdoc -a -r apps/multivio/`
- adjust all occurrences of "} else"
- check SproutCore JS guidelines http://guides.sproutcore.com/style_guide.html


## Detected bugs

- selected item in tree view is not always the one that is clicked (seems to happen when there are several tree entries for the same page) - check record 13146
- the active/inactive state is not always correct for the navigation buttons (<<, <, >, >>)


## Nice-to-haves

- provide better visual info when switching pages, resolution, rotation, etc.
