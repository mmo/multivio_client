Multivio: Generic browser and visualizer for digital objects

<https://www.multivio.org/>

== Description

Multivio is a web application that provides a flexible, functional and enjoyable
platform for accessing digital content, be it in textual format (like books,
articles and journals) or in other media types, including sound and video, or a
mix of any of them. It is designed specifically to work as front end for digital
document repositories and digital libraries.

The application runs natively inside the web browser using JavaScript
technology, and does not require the installation of dedicated software.
(Although specific file formats may require dedicated browser plugins.)

Multivio is open-source software.

== Motivation

Multivio was originally motivated by the requirements of the digital library
RERO DOC <http://doc.rero.ch/>. However, it is meant to be open and adjustable
in order to smoothly integrate with other document servers. It is also modular
and extensible in order to cope with the continuous evolution of digital
formats.

The application is built in-house by RERO (the Library Network of Western
Switzerland) <http://www.rero.ch/> under an open-source license (to be defined),
and integrates existing open-source software components. Its development is
co-sponsored in the framework of the project E-lib.ch: Swiss Electronic library
<http://www.e-lib.ch/>.
